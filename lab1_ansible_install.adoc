= Lab 1: Lab Setup

== Overview of Ansible

Ansible is an open source automation platform that can manage hosts over
the `ssh` protocol. Ansible is described in three words: Simple, Powerful, Agentless.
It is considered simple due to providing human-readable automation. The playbooks
are written using http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html[YAML syntax]
that requires no coding skills and each task within the playbook is executed in
order. Ansible is considered powerful because of its flexibility to automate
your entire app lifecycle. Ansible is agentless thus doesn't require installing
anything on the managed remote hosts. It uses OpenSSH or WinRM to run tasks and
execute Ansible modules to the managed hosts. 

== Ansible Architecture

The Ansible architecture consists of two types of machines labeled: _Control Machine_
and _Managed Nodes_. Ansible is installed on the control machine. The control
machine contains all of the playbooks that are to be run against your managed
nodes. The managed nodes are listed in an _inventory_ file. The inventory
of the managed hosts is either a simple static text file or a dynamic inventory
file created by a set of scripts written by the end user to determine the IPs or the
hostname of the hosts that are to be managed. For the purposes of this lab, the
inventory files will be a static text file. Inventory files include the ability
to group nodes together for easier manageability. For example grouping all 
the database nodes in a group labeled database.

After Ansible takes the input of the nodes to be managed, a playbook that contains
at least one play is executed for the managed nodes that are selected. A play
executes a series of tasks in order on the managed nodes. Each task runs a
specific Ansible module that is specified within your Ansible playbook. The tasks
are what may change the state of the managed hosts as they may install packages
on a system, modify files, and/or change configuration settings. For the
purposes of this lab, the main focus will be on using OpenStack Ansible modules
to manage our OpenStack node. 

A pictorial representation of Ansible's architecture from the Ansible site can

The subsequent sections go into the installation of Ansible and their 
prerequisites.

== Lab environment

Before we proceed to install ansible, let's describe what is the lab environment that is available to us for this exercise.

After ordering the Lab from OpenTLC, you will have have two machines as part of the service: 

* `workstation` : the workstation hosts all the repos and is listening to ssh commands at workstation-{GUID}.rhpds.opentlc.com
* `cloud.example.com` : the cloud system, is an All-in-One OpenStack installation

**Note**: All the Ansible actions will be executed on `workstation` machine. 

== Installation of Prerequisite Tools

In order to use Ansible playbooks against our OpenStack environment, we must
first install the required prerequisites. Your workstation requires the following
to be installed (if not already):

* https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible]
* https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* Text editor (such as `vi`, `emacs` or `nano`)

== Linux Install Instructions

The following subsections provide steps to install `ansible` and `git` for
the following Linux distribution:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

____
As mentioned above, we will be using our OpenStack workstation machine as the ansible controller node in order to facilitate the execution of this lab.

=== RHEL - Ansible & Git Installation Instructions

The preferred method to install `ansible` and `git` on RHEL is using the 
`yum` package manager.

The first step will be to enable the repositories with the packages in RHEL as a `sudo` user, for our environment the repositories needed are already enable and this step is **not required**. 


.Enable the required repositories
----
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms --enable=rhel-7-server-ansible-2-rpms
----

Now, we are going to proceed to install `ansible` and `git`. As a `sudo` user, install the following packages

.Install Ansible and Git
----
sudo yum -y install ansible git
----

.Let's verify that the packages are install by executing the following: 

----
sudo yum list installed ansible git
----
