= Lab 3: Introduction to Playbooks

In lab three, we will focus on learning how to create and structure Ansible Playbooks. After completing this section, you should be able to write basic Ansible playbooks and use the *ansible-playbook* command. This information will be handy to interact programmatically against our OpenStack instance in later labs.

== Ansible Playbooks 

In [underline]#Lab 2# you learned how to run *ad-hoc* commands with Ansible. Ad-hoc commands can run a single, simple task. The real power of Ansible is in how to use playbooks to run multiple, complex tasks against a system or a group of systems in an easily repeatable way.

There are two central concepts to understand before writing playbooks: 

* A **play**: is an ordered set of tasks which should be run against hosts selected from your inventory. 

* A **playbook**: is a text file that contains a list of one or more plays to run in order

== Playbook format

To understand better the structure of a playbook, let us review first an ad-hoc command from Lab 2.

[source,]
----
$ ansible all -m command -a "hostname"
----

The previous command should report the hostname of the system or systems used as target. 

This can be rewritten as a simple single-task play and saved in a playbook. The resulting playbook might appear as follows:

[source,]
----
---
- name: Execute raw command to get hostname from system
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Hostname command
      command: hostname
...
----

A *playbook* is a text file written in http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html[YAML] format, and is normally saved with the extension yml.
The playbook primarily uses indentation with space characters to indicate the structure of its data. YAML doesn't place strict requirements on how many spaces are used for the indentation, but there are two basic rules.

* Data elements at the same level in the hierarchy (such as items in the same list) must have the same indentation.
* Items that are children of another item must be indented more than their parents.
You can also add blank lines for readability.

The playbook begins with a line consisting of three dashes (---) as a start of document marker and it is a good practice to end each playbook with three dots (...) as an end of document marker. 

In between those markers, the playbook is defined as a list of plays. An item in a YAML list starts with a single dash (-) followed by a space. For example, a YAML list might appear as follows:

[source,]
----
- nova
- glance 
- neutron
- cinder
- keystone
- manila
----

The play itself is a collection (an associative array or hash/dictionary) of key: value pairs. Keys in the same play should have the same indentation. The following example describes a YAML hash/dictionary with three keys. The first two keys have simple values. The third has a list of three items as a value.

[source,]
----
name: Example
hosts: Fileservers
tasks: 
  - one
  - two
  - three
----

In the previous example, the play has three keys: name, hosts, and tasks. These keys all have the same indentation because they belong to the play. The first line of the example play starts with a dash and a space (indicating the play is the first item of a list), and then the first key, the name attribute.

Ansible runs them in the same order.*

== Running playbooks


Now that we know the structure of a playbook and how easy could be to write one, let's discuss the ansible-playbook command. The ansible-playbook command is used to run playbooks and is executed in the control (in this case your `workstation` ) node. Using this command could be as simple as the following example: 

[source,]
----
$ ansible-playbook openstack-operator.yml 
----

After the playbook is executed, output is generated to show the play and tasks.

In general, tasks in Ansible playbooks are idempotent, and it is safe to run the playbook multiple times. If the targeted managed hosts are already in the correct state, no changes should be made

=== Verifying the Syntax before running

Before executing a playbook, it is best practice to perform a verification to ensure that the syntax of its contents is correct. The ansible-playbook command offers a `--syntax-check` option which can be used to verify the syntax of a playbook file; it is essential to notice that this will only check the syntax and not if the code is correct for the intended use. The following example shows the successful syntax verification of a playbook.

[source,]
----
$ ansible-playbook --syntax-check openstack-operator.yml 
----

When syntax verification fails, a syntax error is reported.  The following example shows the failed syntax verification of a playbook : 

[source,]
----
[ansible@ansiblehost ~]$ ansible-playbook --syntax-check openstack-operator.yml 
ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
The error appears to have been in '/data/ansible/openstack-operator.yml': line 8, column 2, but
may be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.
----

=== Dry runs

Another best practice while executing playbooks is to perform a dry run. Dry runs are invoked with the `-C` option, which runs Ansible to report the changes that would have occurred if the playbook was executed, but without making actual changes to the managed hosts. 

[source,]
----
$ ansible-playbook -C openstack-operator.yml 
----

== Guided Exercise: Writing a simple Ansible Playbook


At this point, we know how to write and execute basic playbooks. In this section, we will put everything together by using writing a playbook that will perform some basic tasks related to OpenStack. 

To do that, let's create a file in your editor of choice, this file will be named: **prepare-for-lab.yml** that will be performing a couple of tasks: 

* Register EPEL in order to install python2-pip (if using RHEL/CentOS)
* Install pip and upgrade pip
* Install packages gcc, python-devel, libselinux-python, python-openstackclient
* Installing required packages to interact with OpenStack cloud modules from Ansible: 
    - shade - shade is a simple client library for interacting with OpenStack clouds. More details could be found https://pypi.org/project/shade/[Here].

///No need for this part of deployment * Download the latest CirrOS image.

First, create the initial portion of our playbook that defines the name, target, and the first task to install EPEL repository, install pip and upgrade pip:

[source,]
----
- name: Prepare for Lab
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Install EPEL Repository
      package:
        name: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
        state: present
    
    - name: Install pip
      package:
        name: python2-pip
        state: present
    
    - name: Upgrade pip
      shell: pip install --upgrade pip
----

Next, install the required packages such as gcc, python-devel, libselinux-python, and the OpenStack Ansible modules. 

[source,]
----
    - name: Install the required packages
      package: 
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop: 
        - gcc
        - python-devel
        - libselinux-python
        - python-virtualenv
        - ansible-openstack-modules
        - openssl-devel
        - libffi-devel
        
----

Finally, use pip to install setuptools and shade.

[source,]
----
     - name: make sure setuptools is latest
       pip:
         name: setuptools
         state: latest

     - name: install shade
       pip:
         name: shade
         version: 1.27.1
         extra_args: "-Iv"
----

Everything together should look like the following (_prepare-for-lab.yml_):

[source,]
----
---
 - name: Prepare for Lab
   hosts: localhost
   tasks:
     - name: Install EPEL Repository
       package:
         name: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
         state: present
 
     - name: Install pip
       package:
         name: python2-pip
         state: present
    
     - name: Upgrade pip
       shell: pip install --upgrade pip

     - name: Install the required packages
       package: 
         name: "{{ item }}"
         state: present
       loop: 
         - gcc
         - python-devel
         - libselinux-python
         - python-virtualenv
         - ansible-openstack-modules
         - openssl-devel
         - libffi-devel

     - name: make sure setuptools is latest
       pip:
         name: setuptools
         state: latest

     - name: install shade
       pip:
         name: shade
         version: 1.27.1
         extra_args: "-Iv"
...
----

Verify the syntax of the playbook via:

----
$ ansible-playbook --syntax-check prepare-for-lab.yml
----

Execute the playbook via the following command:

----
$ ansible-playbook prepare-for-lab.yml 
----

Verification that `shade` was installed can be done via an ad-hoc command as
follows:

----
$ ansible localhost -m command -a "pip list"
----

The above command will show if the package is currently installed.
